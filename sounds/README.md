# Sound Files Required

This directory should contain two sound files:

1. `intersection.mp3`: A subtle click or beep sound for general intersections
   - Short duration (< 0.5s)
   - Subtle volume
   - Frequency: ~440Hz (A4 note)

2. `corner.mp3`: A distinct sound for corner piece intersections
   - Short duration (< 0.5s)
   - Slightly louder than intersection sound
   - Higher frequency: ~880Hz (A5 note)

You can create these sounds using any audio tool or download free sound effects. Make sure they are:
- Short and responsive
- Not too jarring
- Distinct from each other
- Encoded as MP3 files
